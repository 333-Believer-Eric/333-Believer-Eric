Hi, I'm a recent convert to Christianity around a year and a half ago. I began to strongly think about God and lean towards His existence around 5 years ago,
based on computer coding. I learned enough to code as a hobby, but that was all I needed to see that He exists. Everything in our world can, in theory, 
be simulated by those who <i>are</i> good at coding. 

It can also be used to explain pretty much all of the major existential questions about Chrisitianity and life. Research on the brain has unlocked
predictive algorithms and various types of AI's. The vast majority of experts in the field believe that
a general artificial intelligence smarter than humans will be created within 50 years. When that happens it will not be a little bit smarter, it will
be an existential threat. This could establish a rough timeline for the return of Jesus, when he saves us from the sorrows of this world.

So, say that an artificial general intelligence only exists on a non-internet connected computer, it could then be used to easily explain tougher existential
questions. A soul, in that case, could just be information - a record of all that being ever thought, said, or did. In our case it could be more than that,
as Paul, an Ivy League educated lawyer, compared the body itself to a seed on a few occasions in his letters - which are essentially his journal entries
from when he began evangelisizing the Gospel. He also spoke as though he had inside information, although he didn't specify the source - a dream or vision? 

&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; 1 Corinthians 15:51 - "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed."

Jesus being the first fruits of the transformation into a heavenly body, Paul states that some will be transformed prior to death, the modern day source
of belief in the Rapture. When Jesus comes to save us from all of the sorrow and pain and dishonesty in our world.
Our souls likely have a material essence.

Miracles would be trivial for expert programmers with a word, a touch, or a click of a mouse. In our case, the programmer would have to enable this in the
beginning, I don't think they can adjust this while in progress.

The information from that individual's soul could then be used for evaluation for the afterlife part of the program. In that case, we can't handle much
information so it would be automated by algorithm. In our case, it's stated that Jesus Himself will be our judge. 


&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;"No one comes to the Father except, through the Son." John 14:6 


He is also in position to be the fairest Judge of all.

&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;"Because He Himself has been through suffering and testing, he is able to help us when we are being tested." - Hebrews 2:18 

Our universe has infinite information even at the smallest of scales. Somehow God has a handle on all of it
and knows all of us and all of the information in the world. Including his instructions in Luke Chapter 11 to pray for all things (The right things).

&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;"And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered." Matthew 10:30

&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;"For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened." Luke 11:10

While God even knows our thoughts and cares about them, which have just about infinite information, 
it's stated that our judgment will be based on our words and our actions. 


&emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment." Matthew 12:36.

So there are three of the most important existential questions of Christianity answered in theory, credibly just by computer science. Yet some specks in a 
93 trillion light year universe with infinite information believe that there is no God.

God is real and Jesus is real. A good starting point for those who need more evidence.

<b>Forensic Faith - J. Warner Wallace </b>

<i>Miracles exist. Before Jesus, 31 documented miracles by Jesus, documented miracles of the apostles, and miracles to the present day. So far there have
been types of miracles - Creation (Prophesied Recreation), medical, weather, spirits, and prophecies.</i></br>

<b>The Scriptures Themselves</b>

People are way too sceptical of the Bible. 
"Luke consistently nails the historical details mentioned in the Bible." - Drive Thru History.
Paul's letters are essentially like journal entries, with one trial transcript, a shipwreck where everyone
survived, a stoning, beatings, miracles, prophecies, and persistence and success through peaceful freedom of speech. 
Matthew and John are two of the disciples and firsthand accounts of Jesus' supernatural ministry. 
Luke is a physician and friend of Peter and John Mark was Peter's interpreter in Rome, so those are
two secondhand accounts. Early converts to Christianity did not want to believe and yet did so anyway. 
They overcame anti-Semitism, habits of the brain, history, culture, the entrenched economics of paganism, and threats to their life
to believe and spread Jesus/Yeshua's message of peace, forgiveness, mercy, equality, and love. Why?

<b>God is real and Jesus is real.</b>
